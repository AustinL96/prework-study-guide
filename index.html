        <ul>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The head element's information is not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The head element's information uses metadata to help the browser render the page correctly. This includes data like the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewports.</li>
          <li>The <b>charset</b> element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The <b>http-equiv</b> element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The <b>viewport</b> element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>"p"</b> element defines a paragraph.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A <b>margin</b> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A <b>padding</b> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li><b>Inline CSS</b> is for applying an element directly in the HTML file. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible.</li>
          <li><b>Internal CSS style sheet</b> contains CSS rules for the webpage in the <b>head section</b> of the HTML file. The rules apply only to that page, and a single change will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li><b>External CSS style sheet</b> is the most common. This method stores all CSS rules in a separate file, allowing for easier changes.</li>
          <li>The <b>* element</b> applies CSS rules to all visible elements on a page.</li>
          <li>A <b>comma</b> can allow multiple selectors (such as a header & footer) to be affected by a CSS rule. This cuts down on lines of repeated code.</li>
          <li>The <b>block</b> element takes up the entire width on its line.</li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element creates a connection to an external file.</li>
          <li>The <b>rel</b> attribute specifies the relation between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The <b>href</b> attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external source, using a relative path. Meaning it is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>In HTML, a <b>section</b> element may have a class attribute. To target elements with a specific class, write a period (.) followed by the name of the class.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Javascript is read from top to bottom, meaning the order in which we set up code matters.</li>
          <li>The "<b>console.log</b>" method outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>An "<b>if</b>" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code, but only if the statement is true or meets a condition. If it is, it will do whatever it is asked between "<b>{ }</b>" brackets.</li>
          <li>An "<b>else if</b>" statement can be used to provide more than one condition to an "<b>if</b>" statement.</li>
          <li>The "<b>0</b>" and "<b>null</b>" values are falsey, meaning a computer won't execute code related to them.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator "<b>===</b>" checks to see if two values are equal, returning a Boolean result "true" if the values are. </li>
          <li>An <b>array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, usually data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>An <b>index</b> is a unique number in an array tied to individual data. Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning the first item in any array is <b>0, not 1.</b></li>
          <li>A <b>"for" loop</b> can perform a task on all items in an array by executing a code block over and over, until a specified condition evaluates to false.</li>
          <li><b>Functions</b> set instructions for a computer to perform a task, but unlike loops or other statements, they do not automatically execute when JavaScript is run.</li>
          <li>"<b>Math.floor()</b>" and "<b>Math.random()</b>" are both peroperties of JavaScript's built-in "Math" object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
